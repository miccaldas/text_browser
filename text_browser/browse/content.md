::: {#abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.toc-backref}

This PEP proposes a new system for built-in string formatting operations, intended as a replacement
for the existing '%' string formatting operator.
:::

::: {#rationale .section}
## [Rationale](#rationale){.toc-backref}

Python currently provides two methods of string interpolation:

-   The '%' operator for strings. [\[1\]](#id7){#id1 .footnote-reference .brackets}
-   The string.Template module. [\[2\]](#id8){#id2 .footnote-reference .brackets}

The primary scope of this PEP concerns proposals for built-in string formatting operations (in other
words, methods of the built-in string type).

The '%' operator is primarily limited by the fact that it is a binary operator, and therefore can
take at most two arguments. One of those arguments is already dedicated to the format string,
leaving all other variables to be squeezed into the remaining argument. The current practice is to
use either a dictionary or a tuple as the second argument, but as many people have commented
[\[3\]](#id9){#id3 .footnote-reference .brackets}, this lacks flexibility. The "all or nothing"
approach (meaning that one must choose between only positional arguments, or only named arguments)
is felt to be overly constraining.

While there is some overlap between this proposal and string.Template, it is felt that each serves a
distinct need, and that one does not obviate the other. This proposal is for a mechanism which, like
'%', is efficient for small strings which are only used once, so, for example, compilation of a
string into a template is not contemplated in this proposal, although the proposal does take care to
define format strings and the API in such a way that an efficient template package could reuse the
syntax and even some of the underlying formatting code.
:::

::: {#specification .section}
## [Specification](#specification){.toc-backref}

The specification will consist of the following parts:

-   Specification of a new formatting method to be added to the built-in string class.
-   Specification of functions and flag values to be added to the string module, so that the
    underlying formatting engine can be used with additional options.
-   Specification of a new syntax for format strings.
-   Specification of a new set of special methods to control the formatting and conversion of
    objects.
-   Specification of an API for user-defined formatting classes.
-   Specification of how formatting errors are handled.

Note on string encodings: When discussing this PEP in the context of Python 3.0, it is assumed that
all strings are unicode strings, and that the use of the word 'string' in the context of this
document will generally refer to a Python 3.0 string, which is the same as Python 2.x unicode
object.

In the context of Python 2.x, the use of the word 'string' in this document refers to an object
which may either be a regular string or a unicode object. All of the function call interfaces
described in this PEP can be used for both strings and unicode objects, and in all cases there is
sufficient information to be able to properly deduce the output string type (in other words, there
is no need for two separate APIs). In all cases, the type of the format string dominates - that is,
the result of the conversion will always result in an object that contains the same representation
of characters as the input format string.

::: {#string-methods .section}
### [String Methods](#string-methods){.toc-backref}

The built-in string class (and also the unicode class in 2.6) will gain a new method, 'format',
which takes an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "The story of {0}, {1}, and {c}".format(a, b, c=d)
:::
:::

Within a format string, each positional argument is identified with a number, starting from zero, so
in the above example, 'a' is argument 0 and 'b' is argument 1. Each keyword argument is identified
by its keyword name, so in the above example, 'c' is used to refer to the third argument.

There is also a global built-in function, 'format' which formats a single value:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    print(format(10.0, "7.3g"))
:::
:::

This function is described in a later section.
:::

::: {#format-strings .section}
### [Format Strings](#format-strings){.toc-backref}

Format strings consist of intermingled character data and markup.

Character data is data which is transferred unchanged from the format string to the output string;
markup is not transferred from the format string directly to the output, but instead is used to
define 'replacement fields' that describe to the format engine what should be placed in the output
string in place of the markup.

Brace characters ('curly braces') are used to indicate a replacement field within the string:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "My name is {0}".format('Fred')
:::
:::

The result of this is the string:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "My name is Fred"
:::
:::

Braces can be escaped by doubling:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "My name is {0} :-{{}}".format('Fred')
:::
:::

Which would produce:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "My name is Fred :-{}"
:::
:::

The element within the braces is called a 'field'. Fields consist of a 'field name', which can
either be simple or compound, and an optional 'format specifier'.
:::

::: {#simple-and-compound-field-names .section}
### [Simple and Compound Field Names](#simple-and-compound-field-names){.toc-backref}

Simple field names are either names or numbers. If numbers, they must be valid base-10 integers; if
names, they must be valid Python identifiers. A number is used to identify a positional argument,
while a name is used to identify a keyword argument.

A compound field name is a combination of multiple simple field names in an expression:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "My name is {0.name}".format(open('out.txt', 'w'))
:::
:::

This example shows the use of the 'getattr' or 'dot' operator in a field expression. The dot
operator allows an attribute of an input value to be specified as the field value.

Unlike some other programming languages, you cannot embed arbitrary expressions in format strings.
This is by design - the types of expressions that you can use is deliberately limited. Only two
operators are supported: the '.' (getattr) operator, and the '\[\]' (getitem) operator. The reason
for allowing these operators is that they don't normally have side effects in non-pathological code.

An example of the 'getitem' syntax:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "My name is {0[name]}".format(dict(name='Fred'))
:::
:::

It should be noted that the use of 'getitem' within a format string is much more limited than its
conventional usage. In the above example, the string 'name' really is the literal string 'name', not
a variable named 'name'. The rules for parsing an item key are very simple. If it starts with a
digit, then it is treated as a number, otherwise it is used as a string.

Because keys are not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g.,
the strings "10" or ":-\]") from within a format string.

Implementation note: The implementation of this proposal is not required to enforce the rule about a
simple or dotted name being a valid Python identifier. Instead, it will rely on the getattr function
of the underlying object to throw an exception if the identifier is not legal. The
`str.format()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} function will have a minimalist parser which only
attempts to figure out when it is "done" with an identifier (by finding a '.' or a '\]', or '}',
etc.).
:::

::: {#format-specifiers .section}
### [Format Specifiers](#format-specifiers){.toc-backref}

Each field can also specify an optional set of 'format specifiers' which can be used to adjust the
format of that field. Format specifiers follow the field name, with a colon (':') character
separating the two:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "My name is {0:8}".format('Fred')
:::
:::

The meaning and syntax of the format specifiers depends on the type of object that is being
formatted, but there is a standard set of format specifiers used for any object that does not
override them.

Format specifiers can themselves contain replacement fields. For example, a field whose field width
is itself a parameter could be specified via:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "{0:{1}}".format(a, b)
:::
:::

These 'internal' replacement fields can only occur in the format specifier part of the replacement
field. Internal replacement fields cannot themselves have format specifiers. This implies also that
replacement fields cannot be nested to arbitrary levels.

Note that the doubled '}' at the end, which would normally be escaped, is not escaped in this case.
The reason is because the '{{' and '}}' syntax for escapes is only applied when used **outside** of
a format field. Within a format field, the brace characters always have their normal meaning.

The syntax for format specifiers is open-ended, since a class can override the standard format
specifiers. In such cases, the `str.format()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} method merely passes
all of the characters between the first colon and the matching brace to the relevant underlying
formatting method.
:::

::: {#standard-format-specifiers .section}
### [Standard Format Specifiers](#standard-format-specifiers){.toc-backref}

If an object does not define its own format specifiers, a standard set of format specifiers is used.
These are similar in concept to the format specifiers used by the existing '%' operator, however
there are also a number of differences.

The general form of a standard format specifier is:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    [[fill]align][sign][#][0][minimumwidth][.precision][type]
:::
:::

The brackets (\[\]) indicate an optional element.

Then the optional align flag can be one of the following:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    '<' - Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available
          space (This is the default.)
    '>' - Forces the field to be right-aligned within the
          available space.
    '=' - Forces the padding to be placed after the sign (if any)
          but before the digits.  This is used for printing fields
          in the form '+000000120'. This alignment option is only
          valid for numeric types.
    '^' - Forces the field to be centered within the available
          space.
:::
:::

Note that unless a minimum field width is defined, the field width will always be the same size as
the data to fill it, so that the alignment option has no meaning in this case.

The optional 'fill' character defines the character to be used to pad the field to the minimum
width. The fill character, if present, must be followed by an alignment flag.

The 'sign' option is only valid for numeric types, and can be one of the following:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    '+'  - indicates that a sign should be used for both
           positive as well as negative numbers
    '-'  - indicates that a sign should be used only for negative
           numbers (this is the default behavior)
    ' '  - indicates that a leading space should be used on
           positive numbers
:::
:::

If the '#' character is present, integers use the 'alternate form' for formatting. This means that
binary, octal, and hexadecimal output will be prefixed with '0b', '0o', and '0x', respectively.

'width' is a decimal integer defining the minimum field width. If not specified, then the field
width will be determined by the content.

If the width field is preceded by a zero ('0') character, this enables zero-padding. This is
equivalent to an alignment type of '=' and a fill character of '0'.

The 'precision' is a decimal number indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal
point in a floating point conversion. For non-numeric types the field indicates the maximum field
size - in other words, how many characters will be used from the field content. The precision is
ignored for integer conversions.

Finally, the 'type' determines how the data should be presented.

The available integer presentation types are:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    'b' - Binary. Outputs the number in base 2.
    'c' - Character. Converts the integer to the corresponding
          Unicode character before printing.
    'd' - Decimal Integer. Outputs the number in base 10.
    'o' - Octal format. Outputs the number in base 8.
    'x' - Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using lower-
          case letters for the digits above 9.
    'X' - Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using upper-
          case letters for the digits above 9.
    'n' - Number. This is the same as 'd', except that it uses the
          current locale setting to insert the appropriate
          number separator characters.
    '' (None) - the same as 'd'
:::
:::

The available floating point presentation types are:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    'e' - Exponent notation. Prints the number in scientific
          notation using the letter 'e' to indicate the exponent.
    'E' - Exponent notation. Same as 'e' except it converts the
          number to uppercase.
    'f' - Fixed point. Displays the number as a fixed-point
          number.
    'F' - Fixed point. Same as 'f' except it converts the number
          to uppercase.
    'g' - General format. This prints the number as a fixed-point
          number, unless the number is too large, in which case
          it switches to 'e' exponent notation.
    'G' - General format. Same as 'g' except switches to 'E'
          if the number gets to large.
    'n' - Number. This is the same as 'g', except that it uses the
          current locale setting to insert the appropriate
          number separator characters.
    '%' - Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays
          in fixed ('f') format, followed by a percent sign.
    '' (None) - similar to 'g', except that it prints at least one
          digit after the decimal point.
:::
:::

Objects are able to define their own format specifiers to replace the standard ones. An example is
the 'datetime' class, whose format specifiers might look something like the arguments to the
`strftime()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} function:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "Today is: {0:%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y}".format(datetime.now())
:::
:::

For all built-in types, an empty format specification will produce the equivalent of
`str(value)`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}. It is recommended that objects defining their own
format specifiers follow this convention as well.
:::

::: {#explicit-conversion-flag .section}
### [Explicit Conversion Flag](#explicit-conversion-flag){.toc-backref}

The explicit conversion flag is used to transform the format field value before it is formatted.
This can be used to override the type-specific formatting behavior, and format the value as if it
were a more generic type. Currently, two explicit conversion flags are recognized:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    !r - convert the value to a string using repr().
    !s - convert the value to a string using str().
:::
:::

These flags are placed before the format specifier:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    "{0!r:20}".format("Hello")
:::
:::

In the preceding example, the string "Hello" will be printed, with quotes, in a field of at least 20
characters width.

A custom Formatter class can define additional conversion flags. The built-in formatter will raise a
ValueError if an invalid conversion flag is specified.
:::

::: {#controlling-formatting-on-a-per-type-basis .section}
### [Controlling Formatting on a Per-Type Basis](#controlling-formatting-on-a-per-type-basis){.toc-backref}

Each Python type can control formatting of its instances by defining a `__format__`{.docutils
.literal .notranslate} method. The `__format__`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} method is
responsible for interpreting the format specifier, formatting the value, and returning the resulting
string.

The new, global built-in function 'format' simply calls this special method, similar to how
`len()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} and `str()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} simply call
their respective special methods:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    def format(value, format_spec):
        return value.__format__(format_spec)
:::
:::

It is safe to call this function with a value of "None" (because the "None" value in Python is an
object and can have methods.)

Several built-in types, including 'str', 'int', 'float', and 'object' define `__format__`{.docutils
.literal .notranslate} methods. This means that if you derive from any of those types, your class
will know how to format itself.

The `object.__format__`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} method is the simplest: It simply converts
the object to a string, and then calls format again:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    class object:
        def __format__(self, format_spec):
            return format(str(self), format_spec)
:::
:::

The `__format__`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} methods for 'int' and 'float' will do numeric
formatting based on the format specifier. In some cases, these formatting operations may be
delegated to other types. So for example, in the case where the 'int' formatter sees a format type
of 'f' (meaning 'float') it can simply cast the value to a float and call `format()`{.docutils
.literal .notranslate} again.

Any class can override the `__format__`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} method to provide custom
formatting for that type:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    class AST:
        def __format__(self, format_spec):
            ...
:::
:::

Note for Python 2.x: The 'format_spec' argument will be either a string object or a unicode object,
depending on the type of the original format string. The `__format__`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate} method should test the type of the specifiers parameter to determine whether to return
a string or unicode object. It is the responsibility of the `__format__`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate} method to return an object of the proper type.

Note that the 'explicit conversion' flag mentioned above is not passed to the `__format__`{.docutils
.literal .notranslate} method. Rather, it is expected that the conversion specified by the flag will
be performed before calling `__format__`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}.
:::

::: {#user-defined-formatting .section}
### [User-Defined Formatting](#user-defined-formatting){.toc-backref}

There will be times when customizing the formatting of fields on a per-type basis is not enough. An
example might be a spreadsheet application, which displays hash marks '#' when a value is too large
to fit in the available space.

For more powerful and flexible formatting, access to the underlying format engine can be obtained
through the 'Formatter' class that lives in the 'string' module. This class takes additional options
which are not accessible via the normal str.format method.

An application can subclass the Formatter class to create its own customized formatting behavior.

The PEP does not attempt to exactly specify all methods and properties defined by the
`Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} class; instead, those will be defined and documented in
the initial implementation. However, this PEP will specify the general requirements for the
`Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} class, which are listed below.

Although `string.format()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} does not directly use the
`Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} class to do formatting, both use the same underlying
implementation. The reason that `string.format()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} does not use the
`Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} class directly is because "string" is a built-in type,
which means that all of its methods must be implemented in C, whereas `Formatter`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate} is a Python class. `Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} provides an extensible
wrapper around the same C functions as are used by `string.format()`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate}.
:::

::: {#formatter-methods .section}
### [Formatter Methods](#formatter-methods){.toc-backref}

The `Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} class takes no initialization arguments:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    fmt = Formatter()
:::
:::

The public API methods of class `Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} are as follows:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    -- format(format_string, *args, **kwargs)
    -- vformat(format_string, args, kwargs)
:::
:::

'format' is the primary API method. It takes a format template, and an arbitrary set of positional
and keyword arguments. 'format' is just a wrapper that calls 'vformat'.

'vformat' is the function that does the actual work of formatting. It is exposed as a separate
function for cases where you want to pass in a predefined dictionary of arguments, rather than
unpacking and repacking the dictionary as individual arguments using the `*args`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate} and `**kwds`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} syntax. 'vformat' does the work of
breaking up the format template string into character data and replacement fields. It calls the
'get_positional' and 'get_index' methods as appropriate (described below.)

`Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} defines the following overridable methods:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    -- get_value(key, args, kwargs)
    -- check_unused_args(used_args, args, kwargs)
    -- format_field(value, format_spec)
:::
:::

'get_value' is used to retrieve a given field value. The 'key' argument will be either an integer or
a string. If it is an integer, it represents the index of the positional argument in 'args'; If it
is a string, then it represents a named argument in 'kwargs'.

The 'args' parameter is set to the list of positional arguments to 'vformat', and the 'kwargs'
parameter is set to the dictionary of positional arguments.

For compound field names, these functions are only called for the first component of the field name;
subsequent components are handled through normal attribute and indexing operations.

So for example, the field expression '0.name' would cause 'get_value' to be called with a 'key'
argument of 0. The 'name' attribute will be looked up after 'get_value' returns by calling the
built-in 'getattr' function.

If the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an
`IndexError/KeyError`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} should be raised.

'check_unused_args' is used to implement checking for unused arguments if desired. The arguments to
this function is the set of all argument keys that were actually referred to in the format string
(integers for positional arguments, and strings for named arguments), and a reference to the args
and kwargs that was passed to vformat. The set of unused args can be calculated from these
parameters. 'check_unused_args' is assumed to throw an exception if the check fails.

'format_field' simply calls the global 'format' built-in. The method is provided so that subclasses
can override it.

To get a better understanding of how these functions relate to each other, here is pseudocode that
explains the general operation of vformat:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    def vformat(format_string, args, kwargs):

      # Output buffer and set of used args
      buffer = StringIO.StringIO()
      used_args = set()

      # Tokens are either format fields or literal strings
      for token in self.parse(format_string):
        if is_format_field(token):
          # Split the token into field value and format spec
          field_spec, _, format_spec = token.partition(":")

          # Check for explicit type conversion
          explicit, _, field_spec  = field_spec.rpartition("!")

          # 'first_part' is the part before the first '.' or '['
          # Assume that 'get_first_part' returns either an int or
          # a string, depending on the syntax.
          first_part = get_first_part(field_spec)
          value = self.get_value(first_part, args, kwargs)

          # Record the fact that we used this arg
          used_args.add(first_part)

          # Handle [subfield] or .subfield. Assume that 'components'
          # returns an iterator of the various subfields, not including
          # the first part.
          for comp in components(field_spec):
            value = resolve_subfield(value, comp)

          # Handle explicit type conversion
          if explicit == 'r':
            value = repr(value)
          elif explicit == 's':
            value = str(value)

          # Call the global 'format' function and write out the converted
          # value.
          buffer.write(self.format_field(value, format_spec))

        else:
          buffer.write(token)

      self.check_unused_args(used_args, args, kwargs)
      return buffer.getvalue()
:::
:::

Note that the actual algorithm of the Formatter class (which will be implemented in C) may not be
the one presented here. (It's likely that the actual implementation won't be a 'class' at all -
rather, vformat may just call a C function which accepts the other overridable methods as
arguments.) The primary purpose of this code example is to illustrate the order in which overridable
methods are called.

::: {#customizing-formatters .section}
### [Customizing Formatters](#customizing-formatters){.toc-backref}

This section describes some typical ways that Formatter objects can be customized.

To support alternative format-string syntax, the 'vformat' method can be overridden to alter the way
format strings are parsed.

One common desire is to support a 'default' namespace, so that you don't need to pass in keyword
arguments to the `format()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} method, but can instead use values in a
pre-existing namespace. This can easily be done by overriding `get_value()`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate} as follows:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    class NamespaceFormatter(Formatter):
       def __init__(self, namespace={}):
           Formatter.__init__(self)
           self.namespace = namespace

       def get_value(self, key, args, kwds):
           if isinstance(key, str):
               try:
                   # Check explicitly passed arguments first
                   return kwds[key]
               except KeyError:
                   return self.namespace[key]
           else:
               Formatter.get_value(key, args, kwds)
:::
:::

One can use this to easily create a formatting function that allows access to global variables, for
example:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    fmt = NamespaceFormatter(globals())

    greeting = "hello"
    print(fmt.format("{greeting}, world!"))
:::
:::

A similar technique can be done with the `locals()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} dictionary to
gain access to the locals dictionary.

It would also be possible to create a 'smart' namespace formatter that could automatically access
both locals and globals through snooping of the calling stack. Due to the need for compatibility
with the different versions of Python, such a capability will not be included in the standard
library, however it is anticipated that someone will create and publish a recipe for doing this.

Another type of customization is to change the way that built-in types are formatted by overriding
the 'format_field' method. (For non-built-in types, you can simply define a `__format__`{.docutils
.literal .notranslate} special method on that type.) So for example, you could override the
formatting of numbers to output scientific notation when needed.
:::

::: {#error-handling .section}
### [Error handling](#error-handling){.toc-backref}

There are two classes of exceptions which can occur during formatting: exceptions generated by the
formatter code itself, and exceptions generated by user code (such as a field object's 'getattr'
function).

In general, exceptions generated by the formatter code itself are of the "ValueError" variety --
there is an error in the actual "value" of the format string. (This is not always true; for example,
the `string.format()`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} function might be passed a non-string as its
first parameter, which would result in a `TypeError`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}.)

The text associated with these internally generated `ValueError`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}
exceptions will indicate the location of the exception inside the format string, as well as the
nature of the exception.

For exceptions generated by user code, a trace record and dummy frame will be added to the traceback
stack to help in determining the location in the string where the exception occurred. The inserted
traceback will indicate that the error occurred at:

::: {.highlight-default .notranslate}
::: highlight
    File "<format_string>;", line XX, in column_YY
:::
:::

where XX and YY represent the line and character position information in the string, respectively.
:::
:::

::: {#alternate-syntax .section}
## [Alternate Syntax](#alternate-syntax){.toc-backref}

Naturally, one of the most contentious issues is the syntax of the format strings, and in particular
the markup conventions used to indicate fields.

Rather than attempting to exhaustively list all of the various proposals, I will cover the ones that
are most widely used already.

-   Shell variable syntax: `$name`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} and `$(name)`{.docutils .literal
    .notranslate} (or in some variants, `${name}`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}). This is
    probably the oldest convention out there, and is used by Perl and many others. When used without
    the braces, the length of the variable is determined by lexically scanning until an invalid
    character is found.

    This scheme is generally used in cases where interpolation is implicit - that is, in
    environments where any string can contain interpolation variables, and no special substitution
    function need be invoked. In such cases, it is important to prevent the interpolation behavior
    from occurring accidentally, so the '\$' (which is otherwise a relatively uncommonly-used
    character) is used to signal when the behavior should occur.

    It is the author's opinion, however, that in cases where the formatting is explicitly invoked,
    that less care needs to be taken to prevent accidental interpolation, in which case a lighter
    and less unwieldy syntax can be used.

-   printf and its cousins ('%'), including variations that add a field index, so that fields can be
    interpolated out of order.

-   Other bracket-only variations. Various MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) such as MUSH have used
    brackets (e.g. `[name]`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}) to do string interpolation. The
    Microsoft .Net libraries uses braces (`{}`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}), and a syntax which
    is very similar to the one in this proposal, although the syntax for format specifiers is quite
    different. [\[4\]](#id10){#id4 .footnote-reference .brackets}

-   Backquoting. This method has the benefit of minimal syntactical clutter, however it lacks many
    of the benefits of a function call syntax (such as complex expression arguments, custom
    formatters, etc.).

-   Other variations include Ruby's `#{}`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}, PHP's
    `{$name}`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}, and so on.

Some specific aspects of the syntax warrant additional comments:

1\) Backslash character for escapes. The original version of this PEP used backslash rather than
doubling to escape a bracket. This worked because backslashes in Python string literals that don't
conform to a standard backslash sequence such as `\n`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} are left
unmodified. However, this caused a certain amount of confusion, and led to potential situations of
multiple recursive escapes, i.e. `\\\\{`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} to place a literal
backslash in front of a bracket.

2\) The use of the colon character (':') as a separator for format specifiers. This was chosen
simply because that's what .Net uses.
:::

::: {#alternate-feature-proposals .section}
## [Alternate Feature Proposals](#alternate-feature-proposals){.toc-backref}

Restricting attribute access: An earlier version of the PEP restricted the ability to access
attributes beginning with a leading underscore, for example "{0}.\_private". However, this is a
useful ability to have when debugging, so the feature was dropped.

Some developers suggested that the ability to do 'getattr' and 'getitem' access should be dropped
entirely. However, this is in conflict with the needs of another set of developers who strongly
lobbied for the ability to pass in a large dict as a single argument (without flattening it into
individual keyword arguments using the `**kwargs`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} syntax) and then
have the format string refer to dict entries individually.

There has also been suggestions to expand the set of expressions that are allowed in a format
string. However, this was seen to go against the spirit of TOOWTDI, since the same effect can be
achieved in most cases by executing the same expression on the parameter before it's passed in to
the formatting function. For cases where the format string is being use to do arbitrary formatting
in a data-rich environment, it's recommended to use a template engine specialized for this purpose,
such as Genshi [\[5\]](#id11){#id5 .footnote-reference .brackets} or Cheetah [\[6\]](#id12){#id6
.footnote-reference .brackets}.

Many other features were considered and rejected because they could easily be achieved by
subclassing `Formatter`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} instead of building the feature into the
base implementation. This includes alternate syntax, comments in format strings, and many others.

::: {#security-considerations .section}
## [Security Considerations](#security-considerations){.toc-backref}

Historically, string formatting has been a common source of security holes in web-based
applications, particularly if the string formatting system allows arbitrary expressions to be
embedded in format strings.

The best way to use string formatting in a way that does not create potential security holes is to
never use format strings that come from an untrusted source.

Barring that, the next best approach is to ensure that string formatting has no side effects.
Because of the open nature of Python, it is impossible to guarantee that any non-trivial operation
has this property. What this PEP does is limit the types of expressions in format strings to those
in which visible side effects are both rare and strongly discouraged by the culture of Python
developers. So for example, attribute access is allowed because it would be considered pathological
to write code where the mere access of an attribute has visible side effects (whether the code has
**invisible** side effects - such as creating a cache entry for faster lookup - is irrelevant.)

::: {#backwards-compatibility .section}
## [Backwards Compatibility](#backwards-compatibility){.toc-backref}

Backwards compatibility can be maintained by leaving the existing mechanisms in place. The new
system does not collide with any of the method names of the existing string formatting techniques,
so both systems can co-exist until it comes time to deprecate the older system.
